# 🎯 Task 12.4: Memory & CPU Optimization

## 📅 Sprint Info
- **Duration:** 3 days
- **Milestone:** M9 - Production Performance
- **Priority:** P1
- **Depends On:** Tasks 12.1-12.3 ✅
- **Blocks:** Task 12.5 (Load Testing)
- **Assignee:** TBD

## 🎬 What You'll Build
Optimize memory usage, CPU utilization, and data structures for production scalability. Reduce memory footprint by 30% and improve CPU efficiency by 20% across the entire pipeline.

## 📋 Daily Breakdown

### Day 1: Memory Profiling & Optimization
- [ ] Profile memory usage (Valgrind, heaptrack)
- [ ] Identify memory leaks and hotspots
- [ ] Optimize data structures (use flat arrays, pools)
- [ ] Implement object pooling for hot paths
- [ ] Reduce allocations in critical paths
- [ ] Memory regression tests

### Day 2: CPU Optimization
- [ ] Profile CPU usage (perf, flamegraphs)
- [ ] Optimize hot paths (inlining, SIMD)
- [ ] Reduce unnecessary computations
- [ ] Parallelize independent operations
- [ ] Cache computation results
- [ ] CPU regression tests

### Day 3: Integration & Validation
- [ ] End-to-end performance testing
- [ ] Validate memory reduction ≥30%
- [ ] Validate CPU improvement ≥20%
- [ ] Load testing under optimization
- [ ] Documentation

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Memory usage reduced by ≥30%
- [ ] CPU efficiency improved by ≥20%
- [ ] No memory leaks detected
- [ ] Throughput increased by ≥15%
- [ ] Latency maintained or improved
- [ ] Stable under sustained load
