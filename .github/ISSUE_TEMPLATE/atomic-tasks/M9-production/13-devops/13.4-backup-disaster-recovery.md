# 🎯 Task 13.4: Backup & Disaster Recovery

## 📅 Sprint Info
- **Duration:** 3 days
- **Milestone:** M9 - Production DevOps
- **Priority:** P1
- **Depends On:** None
- **Blocks:** Production readiness
- **Assignee:** TBD

## 🎬 What You'll Build
Implement comprehensive backup strategy for indexes, feature stores, and databases. Create disaster recovery procedures with documented RTO/RPO and tested recovery processes.

## 📋 Daily Breakdown

### Day 1: Backup Infrastructure
- [ ] Design backup strategy (full + incremental)
- [ ] Implement MongoDB automated backups (daily)
- [ ] Implement Redis persistence and snapshots
- [ ] Set up index backup (RedisSearch)
- [ ] Add feature store backups
- [ ] Configure backup retention (30 days)
- [ ] Test backup integrity

### Day 2: Disaster Recovery Procedures
- [ ] Document RTO/RPO targets (RTO: 1h, RPO: 24h)
- [ ] Create restore scripts (automated)
- [ ] Build disaster recovery runbook
- [ ] Implement multi-region backup (optional)
- [ ] Add backup monitoring and alerts
- [ ] Test restore procedures

### Day 3: Testing & Validation
- [ ] Perform full disaster recovery drill
- [ ] Validate restore time within RTO
- [ ] Test partial restore scenarios
- [ ] Documentation and team training
- [ ] Backup automation validation

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Automated daily backups running
- [ ] Backup retention policies enforced (30 days)
- [ ] Restore procedures documented and tested
- [ ] RTO ≤1 hour, RPO ≤24 hours
- [ ] Disaster recovery drill successful
- [ ] Team trained on procedures

## 📦 Deliverables

## 📊 Success Metrics
- **RTO:** ≤1 hour (recovery time)
- **RPO:** ≤24 hours (data loss window)
- **Reliability:** 100% backup success rate
- **Recovery:** DR drill successful
