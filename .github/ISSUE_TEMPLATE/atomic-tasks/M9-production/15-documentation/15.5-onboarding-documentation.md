- **Stretch:** Video tutorials and screencasts

## Tasks

### Getting Started Guide

- [ ] **Welcome & Project Overview**
  - Project mission and goals
  - Universal multilingual search engine vision
  - Key features and differentiators
  - Success metrics and milestones
  - Team structure and roles

- [ ] **Development Environment Setup**
  ```markdown
  # Development Environment Setup
  
  ## Prerequisites
  - Linux/macOS/WSL2 (Windows)
  - Docker & Docker Compose
  - Git
  - C++ compiler (GCC 11+ or Clang 14+)
  - Python 3.9+
  - Node.js 18+
  
  ## Clone Repository
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/your-org/search-engine-core.git
  cd search-engine-core
  ```
  
  ## Install Dependencies
  ```bash
  # C++ dependencies (vcpkg)
  ./scripts/install-deps.sh
  
  # Python dependencies
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  
  # Node.js dependencies (if applicable)
  npm install
  ```
  
  ## Start Services
  ```bash
  # Start all services with Docker Compose
  docker compose up -d
  
  # Verify services running
  docker ps
  
  # Check logs
  docker logs core --tail 50
  ```
  
  ## Verify Setup
  ```bash
  # Test search API
  curl "http://localhost:3000/api/v2/search?q=test"
  
  # Test health endpoint
  curl "http://localhost:3000/api/v2/health"
  
  # Open frontend
  open http://localhost:3000
  ```
  
  ## Common Issues
  - **Port conflicts:** Change ports in docker-compose.yml
  - **Permission denied:** Run with sudo or add user to docker group
  - **Build errors:** Check compiler version and dependencies
  ```
