# 🎯 Task 14.3: Network Isolation & Egress Control

## 📅 Sprint Info
- **Duration:** 2 days
- **Milestone:** Security & Compliance
- **Priority:** P1
- **Depends On:** None
- **Blocks:** Production security audit
- **Assignee:** TBD

## 🎬 What You'll Build
Implement network segmentation and egress control policies. Restrict outbound connections to only necessary services (allowlist-based), preventing data exfiltration and unauthorized access.

## 📋 Daily Breakdown

### Day 1: Network Policies
- [ ] Design network segmentation architecture
- [ ] Create Kubernetes NetworkPolicies
- [ ] Implement egress deny by default
- [ ] Build service allowlist (MongoDB, Redis, DNS)
- [ ] Add Docker network isolation
- [ ] Configure firewall rules
- [ ] Documentation

### Day 2: Testing & Validation
- [ ] Test egress restrictions
- [ ] Validate allowlist functionality
- [ ] Verify inter-service communication
- [ ] Security audit
- [ ] Documentation

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Egress deny by default enforced
- [ ] Only allowlisted services accessible
- [ ] Inter-service communication working
- [ ] No unauthorized egress detected
- [ ] Security audit passed

## 📦 Deliverables
- `k8s/network-policies/egress-deny.yaml`
- `k8s/network-policies/service-allowlist.yaml`
- `docker-compose.security.yml` (network configs)
- `docs/security/network-isolation.md`

## 📊 Success Metrics
- **Isolation:** 100% egress controlled
- **Allowlist:** Only necessary services accessible
- **Audit:** Security scan passed
