# 🎯 Task 08.4: Ranking Integration & End-to-End Testing

## 📅 Sprint Info
- **Duration:** 3 days
- **Milestone:** M6 - Ranking Fusion
- **Priority:** P0 (Critical Path)
- **Depends On:** Tasks 08.1, 08.2, 08.3 ✅
- **Blocks:** Production deployment
- **Assignee:** TBD

## 🎬 What You'll Build
Integrate all ranking components (feature fusion, diversification, optimized weights) into production pipeline. Comprehensive end-to-end testing to validate quality improvements across all languages.

## 📋 Daily Breakdown

### Day 1: Integration
- [ ] Integrate feature fusion into query pipeline
- [ ] Add MMR diversification layer
- [ ] Apply optimized weights from tuning
- [ ] Build unified ranking pipeline
- [ ] Add monitoring and metrics
- [ ] Performance profiling

### Day 2: Testing & Validation
- [ ] End-to-end integration tests (100+ queries)
- [ ] Multi-language validation (10+ languages)
- [ ] Quality regression tests
- [ ] Performance benchmarks (P95 ≤300ms)
- [ ] Load testing (1000+ QPS)
- [ ] Edge case testing

### Day 3: Deployment Preparation
- [ ] Create deployment checklist
- [ ] Build rollback procedures
- [ ] Add feature flags for gradual rollout
- [ ] Final documentation
- [ ] Team training
- [ ] Production readiness review

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Full ranking pipeline integrated
- [ ] End-to-end latency P95 ≤300ms
