# 🎯 Task 07.5: Quality Scoring Pipeline Integration

## 📅 Sprint Info
- **Duration:** 3 days
- **Milestone:** M5 - Quality & Spam Detection
- **Priority:** P1
- **Depends On:** All 07.x tasks ✅
- **Blocks:** Task 08.2 (Feature Fusion)
- **Assignee:** TBD

## 🎬 What You'll Build
Integrate all quality/spam detection components into unified scoring pipeline. Combine One-Class SVM, Isolation Forest, and site reputation for final quality score used in ranking.

## 📋 Daily Breakdown

### Day 1: Pipeline Architecture
- [ ] Design unified scoring pipeline
- [ ] Combine model predictions (ensemble)
- [ ] Integrate site reputation scores
- [ ] Add confidence calibration
- [ ] Build filtering thresholds
- [ ] Unit tests

### Day 2: Integration & Optimization
- [ ] Integrate with indexing pipeline
- [ ] Add batch scoring for documents
- [ ] Implement caching (Redis)
- [ ] Performance optimization (<5ms per doc)
- [ ] Multi-language validation

### Day 3: Deployment & Monitoring
- [ ] C++ integration for serving
- [ ] Build quality score dashboard
- [ ] Add alerting for quality drops
- [ ] Create A/B test configuration
- [ ] Documentation and runbooks

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Unified quality score: 0.0 (spam) to 1.0 (high quality)
- [ ] Combined precision ≥90% spam detection
- [ ] False positive rate <2% on quality content
- [ ] Pipeline latency <5ms per document
- [ ] Integrated into ranking formula
- [ ] Works across all languages
