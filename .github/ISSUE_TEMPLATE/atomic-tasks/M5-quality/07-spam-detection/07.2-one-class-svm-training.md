# 🎯 Task 07.2: One-Class SVM Training

## 📅 Sprint Info
- **Duration:** 3 days
- **Milestone:** M5 - Quality & Spam Detection
- **Priority:** P1
- **Depends On:** Task 07.1 (Feature Extraction) ✅
- **Blocks:** Task 07.5 (Quality Scoring Pipeline)
- **Assignee:** TBD

## 🎬 What You'll Build
Train One-Class SVM on quality content baseline to detect spam/anomalies without labeled spam examples. Unsupervised approach works across any language automatically.

## 📋 Daily Breakdown

### Day 1: Training Data Preparation
- [ ] Collect quality content baseline (10K+ pages)
- [ ] Filter high-quality sources (authoritative domains)
- [ ] Extract spam features for training set
- [ ] Feature normalization and scaling
- [ ] Train/validation split
- [ ] Data quality validation

### Day 2: Model Training & Tuning
- [ ] Implement One-Class SVM (scikit-learn)
- [ ] Hyperparameter tuning (nu, gamma, kernel)
- [ ] Cross-validation
- [ ] Outlier sensitivity tuning
- [ ] Model evaluation on validation set
- [ ] Feature importance analysis

### Day 3: Testing & Export
- [ ] Test on known spam/quality pages
- [ ] Multi-language validation
- [ ] Model serialization
- [ ] Performance benchmarking (<5ms inference)
- [ ] Documentation

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Training on 10K+ quality pages
- [ ] Spam detection precision ≥85%
- [ ] False positive rate <2% on quality content
- [ ] Inference latency <5ms per document
- [ ] Works across 10+ languages
- [ ] Model size <50MB

## 📦 Deliverables
- `src/python/spam_detector/one_class_svm.py` (300 lines)
- `src/python/spam_detector/trainer.py` (250 lines)

- `tests/test_one_class_svm.py` (40+ cases)
- `docs/one-class-svm-guide.md`

## 📊 Success Metrics
- **Precision:** ≥85%
- **False Positive Rate:** <2%
- **Latency:** <5ms
- **Coverage:** 10+ languages
