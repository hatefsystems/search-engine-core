# 🎯 Task 07.3: Isolation Forest Training

## 📅 Sprint Info
- **Duration:** 2 days
- **Milestone:** M5 - Quality & Spam Detection
- **Priority:** P1
- **Depends On:** Task 07.1 (Feature Extraction) ✅
- **Blocks:** Task 07.5 (Quality Scoring Pipeline)
- **Assignee:** TBD

## 🎬 What You'll Build
Train Isolation Forest for anomaly-based spam detection. Complementary approach to One-Class SVM for catching different spam patterns across all languages.

## 📋 Daily Breakdown

### Day 1: Model Training
- [ ] Implement Isolation Forest (scikit-learn)
- [ ] Use same quality baseline as One-Class SVM
- [ ] Hyperparameter tuning (n_estimators, contamination)
- [ ] Feature importance analysis
- [ ] Model evaluation

### Day 2: Testing & Integration
- [ ] Validation on spam/quality pages
- [ ] Ensemble with One-Class SVM
- [ ] Performance benchmarking
- [ ] Model serialization
- [ ] Documentation

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Anomaly detection precision ≥80%
- [ ] Catches different spam patterns than SVM
- [ ] Inference latency <3ms
- [ ] Ensemble improves overall detection
- [ ] Works across 10+ languages

## 📦 Deliverables
- `src/python/spam_detector/isolation_forest.py` (200 lines)
- `models/isolation_forest_v1.pkl`
- `tests/test_isolation_forest.py` (30+ cases)
- `docs/isolation-forest-guide.md`

## 📊 Success Metrics
- **Precision:** ≥80%
- **Complementarity:** Catches different spam than SVM
- **Latency:** <3ms
- **Ensemble:** Combined precision ≥90%
