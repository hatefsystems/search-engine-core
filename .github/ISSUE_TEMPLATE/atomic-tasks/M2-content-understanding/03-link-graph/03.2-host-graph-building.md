# 🎯 Task 03.2: Host Graph Building

## 📅 Sprint Info
- **Duration:** 4 days | **Milestone:** M2 | **Priority:** P1
- **Depends On:** 03.1 ✅ | **Blocks:** 03.3

## 🎬 What You'll Build
Aggregate URL-level links into host-level graph. Collapse by eTLD+1 for PageRank computation.

## 📋 Daily Tasks
**Day 1:** eTLD+1 extraction (publicsuffix library)  
**Day 2:** Host graph aggregation from URL graph  
**Day 3:** Graph storage optimization, edge weight calculation  
**Day 4:** Testing with 100M+ edges, validation

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- Accurate eTLD+1 extraction
- Host graph with weighted edges
- Handles 100M+ edges efficiently
- Ready for PageRank computation

## 🎉 Celebration: Host graph visualization!
## 📦 Delivers: `host_graph_builder.py`
## 🚀 Next: Task 03.3 (PageRank)
