# 🎯 Task 05.1: Co-occurrence Matrix

## 📅 Sprint Info
- **Duration:** 5 days | **M3** | **P1** | **Depends:** 04.4 ✅ | **Blocks:** 05.2

## 🎬 What You'll Build
Build co-occurrence matrix from corpus (window=5-10). Foundation for PPMI/SVD embeddings and synonym discovery.

## 📋 Daily Breakdown
**Day 1-2:** Sliding window co-occurrence counter, sparse matrix storage  
**Day 3:** PPMI (Positive PMI) calculation, SVD decomposition  
**Day 4:** Low-rank embedding generation (300 dims)  
**Day 5:** Validation (neighbor quality), performance optimization

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- Processes 100M+ documents
- Generates sparse co-occurrence matrix
- PPMI + SVD produces quality embeddings
- Intrinsic evaluation: coherent neighbors
- Completes within 12 hours for full corpus

## 🎉 Celebration: Show semantic neighbors ("king" → "queen", "monarch")!
