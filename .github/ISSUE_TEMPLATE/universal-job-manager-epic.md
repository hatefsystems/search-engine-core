# 🚀 **Epic: Universal Job Manager System Implementation**

## 📋 **Issue Description**

Implement a comprehensive, enterprise-grade job management system that transforms our search engine from synchronous domain crawling to an asynchronous, scalable job processing platform.

- **UX**: Provide real-time job status updates in web browser
- **Enterprise**: Multi-tenant support with resource quotas and monitoring

## 📝 **Additional Notes**

### **Critical Implementation Rules**
- **ALWAYS** use lazy initialization in controllers (no service init in constructors)
- **ALWAYS** pair `res->onData()` with `res->onAborted()` for uWebSockets safety
- **ALWAYS** use `LOG_DEBUG()` instead of `std::cout` (configurable via LOG_LEVEL)
- **ALWAYS** initialize MongoDB with `MongoDBInstance::getInstance()` before client creation

### **Priority Order**
1. **Phase 1 & 2**: Core job system and crawler integration (MVP)
2. **Phase 3**: Real-time web interface (user experience)
3. **Phase 4**: Advanced features (enterprise value)
4. **Phase 5 & 6**: Production hardening (reliability)

### **Success Metrics**
- API response time improvement (from seconds to milliseconds)
- User engagement increase (real-time status visibility)
- System reliability improvement (job failure handling)
- **Zero job loss** on application restart/crash
- **Resume time** < 30 seconds after application restart
- Developer productivity increase (reusable job framework)
