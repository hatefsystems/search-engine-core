# Subtask 13: DevOps, Reliability & Safe Deployment (M9)

## Issue Title
`[M9][devops] SLOs, alerts, canaries, rollbacks & runbooks`

## Summary
Implement production-ready DevOps practices including monitoring, alerting, safe deployment strategies, and incident response for the universal multilingual search engine. Ensure system reliability and fast recovery across all supported languages.

## Implementation Language
**Primary: Infrastructure as Code** (Docker, Kubernetes, monitoring)
**Integration: C++** (health checks, metrics export)

## Technical Requirements
- Comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- Blue/green or canary deployment strategies
- Automated rollbacks and recovery
- Runbooks for common incidents
- SLO/SLA definition and tracking

## Tasks
- [ ] Define SLIs/SLOs (latency, error rate, freshness)
- [ ] Set up monitoring stack (Prometheus, Grafana, alerts)
- [ ] Implement health checks and metrics export in C++
- [ ] Build canary deployment pipeline
- [ ] Create automated rollback mechanisms
- [ ] Write runbooks for index rebuild, model rollback, cache flush
- [ ] Implement backup and disaster recovery
- [ ] Add security hardening and audit logging
- [ ] Set up performance regression testing

## Acceptance Criteria
- All SLIs/SLOs defined with automated monitoring
- Alert fatigue eliminated (actionable alerts only)
- Successful canary deployment with rollback capability
- Runbooks tested in drill scenarios
- MTTR targets met for critical incidents

## Dependencies
- Docker/Kubernetes for container orchestration
- Prometheus/Grafana for monitoring
- CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions, etc.)
- Load testing tools (vegeta, k6)
- Backup storage solutions

## Infrastructure Components

### Monitoring Stack
```yaml
# docker-compose.monitoring.yml
services:
  prometheus:
    image: prom/prometheus
    volumes:
      - ./monitoring/prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml

  grafana:
    image: grafana/grafana
    environment:
      - GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin

  alertmanager:
    image: prom/alertmanager
    volumes:
      - ./monitoring/alerts.yml:/etc/alertmanager/alertmanager.yml
```

### Health Checks (C++)
```cpp
// Health check endpoints
class HealthService : public routing::Controller {
public:
    void health_check(uWS::HttpResponse<false>* res, uWS::HttpRequest* req);
    void metrics_endpoint(uWS::HttpResponse<false>* res, uWS::HttpRequest* req);
    void readiness_probe(uWS::HttpResponse<false>* res, uWS::HttpRequest* req);

private:
    bool check_mongodb_connection();
    bool check_redis_connection();
    bool check_embedding_service();
    std::string collect_system_metrics();
};
```

### Deployment Strategy
```yaml
# Kubernetes deployment with canary
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: search-engine-canary
spec:
  replicas: 1  # Start with 1 canary pod
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: search-engine
      track: canary
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: search-engine
        track: canary
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: search-engine
        image: search-engine:new-version
        # Health checks, resource limits, etc.
```

## Files to Create/Modify
- `docker-compose.monitoring.yml`
- `monitoring/prometheus.yml`
- `monitoring/grafana-dashboards/`
- `monitoring/alerts.yml`
- `k8s/deployment.yml`
- `k8s/service.yml`
- `include/health/HealthService.h`
- `src/health/HealthService.cpp`
- `runbooks/`
- `scripts/rollback.sh`

## Notes
- Infrastructure as Code for reproducibility
- C++ integration for application health metrics
- Comprehensive runbooks prevent knowledge silos
- Automated testing prevents regressions
